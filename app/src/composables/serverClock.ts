/**
 * A self-hosted shared clock to replace MCorp.
 *
 * Given the four timestamps of each measurement round trip, it recovers the
 * server's clock via the NTP method and exposes it as a position in seconds —
 * the same shape as MCorp's `motion.pos`, so it drops into the existing
 * `setMotionRef` seam with no other playback changes. Estimation is offset-only
 * over a rolling, lowest-RTT-filtered window: the lowest-RTT round trips are the
 * least path-asymmetric (the main source of NTP bias), and frequent re-estimation
 * absorbs the slow drift measured on real devices (~0.4 ms/min), so no skew term
 * is needed.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so both the device and the admin client can share it.
